# TMT2 Frontend

## Ideas

- Pulse map in red if bomb is planted
- Show alive player count per team
- Show who picked/banned map
- Show who picked which side
- Show who won knife round

## Most needed actions during tournament

Assuming most matches are BO1!

- Change played map to something specific
- Change game server
- Execute arbitrary rcon command (& get response)
- Stop/Cancel match
- rollback round
- switch teams (only names ingame)

# TMT2 - Tournament Match Tracker 2

TMT is a tool that tracks/watches/observes a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive match.

This project is a complete rewrite of the former [TMT](https://github.com/JensForstmann/CSGO-PHP-TournamentMatchTracker).

TMT2 is split into two separate parts: backend and frontend.

## TMT2 Backend

This is where the magic happens.

It will keep track of matches and can interact with 3rd party applications like tournament systems,
websites or others via a REST API and webhooks to send real time notifications.

## TMT2 Frontend

Currently only a "maybe" or "planned" sub project.

Might be a universal web interface to see the status of the TMT2, list the matches, see stats, start new matches...

Basically to control the backend in any possible way.
